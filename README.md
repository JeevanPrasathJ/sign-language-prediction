# sign-language-prediction
Objective: Develop a robust machine learning system for predicting alphabetic and numerical characters based on sign language gestures.

Workflow:
Dataset Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of hand gesture images using a webcam. Each gesture represents a specific alphabetic character. Organize the images systematically to facilitate model training.

Image Preprocessing: Employ advanced techniques to extract precise hand landmarks from the collected images. Leveraging the power of MediaPipe Hands library, transform raw images into rich feature representations.

Model Training: Train a sophisticated machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset. Utilize the Random Forest algorithm to learn intricate patterns between hand landmarks and corresponding alphabetic characters.

Real-Time Prediction: Deploy the trained model for real-time prediction using live video feed from the webcam. Implement seamless integration to capture and analyze gestures in real-world scenarios.

Result Visualization: Capture snapshots of the real-time prediction results for comprehensive analysis and visualization. Store these snapshots in the "results" directory to track model performance and enhance interpretability.
